# Control My Robot

The goal of this repo is to start by replicating a tweet I saw where a someone coded a website such that it can control the motor of a SO-100 with feetech motors from a web interface. This is the [original repo](https://github.com/dora-bambot/dora-bambot.github.io) of the person that inspired me.
